# MyTerrY

Its an app to manage JW Territory Cards in a more visual way. I decided to use the Material Design for Android Library to get related with the tools coming up.

The basic functional specs are:

    Create a view model of the territory (blocks and the whole space)
    Include notes inside the territory (return visits excluded)
    Have a Search street function to find it faster the first time attending the territory
    Share a snapshot of the territory
    Multilanguage support

Future versions:

    Share territory (web, bluetooth, other)
    Group editing a territory (online required)
